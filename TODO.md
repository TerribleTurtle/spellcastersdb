# SpellcastersDB.com Task List

> **Note:** Completed tasks from Phases 0-10 have been moved to `ARCHIVE.md`.

## Future Backlog

- [x] **PWA & Offline Support**: Phases 1–4 complete (manifest, service worker, `/~offline`, `OfflineIndicator` UX) — see [`docs/PWA_PLAN.md`](docs/PWA_PLAN.md)
- [ ] **User Accounts**: Auth via Supabase/NextAuth
- [ ] **Cloud Decks**: Save decks to cloud account instead of localStorage
- [ ] **Public Profile**: Shareable user profile with favorite decks
- [ ] **Deck Ratings**: Community voting system
- [ ] **Patch History Data Pipeline**: Deploy balance_index, changelog, timeline JSON endpoints
- [ ] **TanStack Query**: Adopt `@tanstack/react-query` for client-side server state when User Accounts / Cloud Decks ship (low risk, incremental — see ROI report). Pairs with Zustand (client state) without conflict.
